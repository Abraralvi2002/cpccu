By offering programming instruction, hosting educational seminars, and providing a venue for open-source software contributions, we hope to provide people the chance to practice and build skills necessary for computer science and engineering. Allowing students to contribute to the development of communication, queries, and recommendations. To encouraging students to learn on their own by sharing and learning from the community. To encouraging pupils to think critically, act creatively, and display their abilities.  To development of a cooperative attitude. Ultimately, we are encouraging and expanding the understanding of students interested in technology so that they may share their expertise and gain from one another. These activities make every student wiser, allow them to stay positive, active, and prepare them for future duties.",
